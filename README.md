# Your Plugin Name

A short description of your plugin.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts a local dev server and connects to FlexDesigner via WebSocket. Changes to backend code are hot-reloaded automatically.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles TypeScript and bundles frontend pages into `dist/`.

## Publishing to the Marketplace

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions.

### First-time setup

1. Register your plugin in FlexDesigner Marketplace (Settings → My Uploads → Publish Plugin)
2. Copy the generated webhook secret
3. Add it to your GitHub repo: **Settings → Secrets → Actions** → `FLEX_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Releasing a new version

1. Push your changes to `main`
2. Create a new GitHub Release with a semver tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`)
3. The workflow builds, packs, and notifies the marketplace server automatically
4. If no permission or platform changes, the update goes live immediately
5. If permissions or platforms changed, it enters the review queue

### Native plugins

If your plugin requires native Node.js addons (`native: true` in manifest.json), the workflow runs a matrix build across all declared platforms. Each platform produces a separate `.flexplugin` artifact.

## Manifest fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `uuid` | `@username/plugin-name` — must match your marketplace account |
| `minHostVersion` | Minimum FlexDesigner version required |
| `native` | Set `true` if the plugin uses native addons |
| `platforms` | Supported OS+arch combinations |
| `devices` | Target device models |
| `requiredCapabilities` | Device capabilities the plugin needs at runtime |
| `permissions` | Host API permissions (sensitive ones require review) |
| `dependencies` | Other marketplace plugins this plugin depends on |
